# EpisodeAlgorithm
This is the most recent set of programs that creates episodes of care following an acute hospitalization discharge.
The episode of care follows all acute and post-acute care for a beneficiary as captured by Medicare claims and assessment data.
Data sources include 100% MedPAR, Home Health Agencies, Minimum Dataset (MDS) assessment tool, and Master Beneficiary Summary Files.
Set the macros in 0_Assign_Macros program, then run the programs in order.
